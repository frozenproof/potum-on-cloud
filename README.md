# Quick stuffs about me
### I am the one who you would call when the situation is hopeless, the mighty are crumbling to dust. I am the last wall standing .

# Professional details  - If you can even call it that
- I love modding games with codes .
- I love testing codes and stuffs , as much as I want to improve them .

# Coding languages I happened to scan across
- C++ , sweet C++ . I dream of it in my sleep.
- Java , my nightmare . It's not hard , just the testing phase is ultra painful .
- Python , my fun . I tried coding game on it , only to learn I was doing it the wrong way .
- Lua , the modding holy grail . It's everywhere .
- vsnut , the old language of Valve game engine . Always wondered how it came to be .
- Haskell , the old relic I enjoyed wrecking pc with . Very confusing yet fascinating .
- C# , the political coding dogma .
- Javascript , the holy grail of pretty much everything. How did it even come into existence on this planet ?

# Important details - Do not skip if you wanted to know more 
- First of all , I'm a very patient person . That does not mean I'm gentle .
- Secondly , I'm , by all means , a control freak . A very powerful control freak , but you will never hear about me anywhere .
- Thirdly , I'm very sentimental about any help / tribute I received . That means I will allow certain numbers of things happen under my nose , as long as I benefit from it.
- Last, finally . please do not upset me . I will not be able to control myself doing terrible things in for the sake of a deal I can't save ( looking at you , shizuka / peach ).
